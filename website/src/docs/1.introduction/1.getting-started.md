## What is Kin Form?

Kin Form is a library that makes working with forms so easy in [Lit] applications.

It is packed with almost everything you need to create forms in a flexible,
declarative, and type-safe way.

The name Kin Form is derived from my nickname (Kin), for the sake of simplicity.
We all know how hard it is to name things!

## Motivation

Kin Form started many years ago when I needed to build a complex admin portal
using [Lit] for my company Accumulus. There were roughly 40 forms, ranging from
simple ones with a few fields to complex ones with deeply nested objects and
arrays. I couldn't find a robust form management library for [Lit], so I decided
to build my own.

After its success at Accumulus, I continued to refine the library and used it to
build another admin portal for [Restful Mind].

The library has served me so well that I believe it will benefit many others too.
That's why I decided to turn it into an open source project.

## Installation

Kin Form is available on [jsr].

deno add jsr:@kin/form
pnpm add jsr:@kin/form # v10.9.0+
