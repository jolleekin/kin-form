## What is Kin Form?

Kin Form is a library that makes working with forms easy in [Lit] applications.

It is packed with almost everything you need to create forms in a flexible,
declarative, and type-safe way.

The name Kin Form is derived from my nickname (Kin), for the sake of simplicity.
We all know how hard it is to name things!

## Motivation

Kin Form started many years ago when I needed to build a complex admin portal
using [Lit] for my company Accumulus. There were roughly 40 forms, ranging from
simple ones with a few fields to complex ones with deeply nested objects and
arrays. I couldn't find a robust form management library for [Lit], so I decided
to build my own.

After its success at Accumulus, I continued to refine the library and used it to
build another admin portal for [Restful Mind].

The library has served me so well that I believe it will benefit many others too.
That's why I decided to turn it into an open source project.

## Installation

Kin Form is available on [jsr].

```sh
deno add jsr:@kin/form
pnpm add jsr:@kin/form # v10.9.0+
yarn add jsr:@kin/form # v4.9+
npx  jsr add @kin/form
```

## Basic Usage

Here is a complete example of a simple login form to get you started.

First, ensure you have the necessary imports and that you have defined custom elements for your form fields (e.g., `text-field`). For simplicity, this example assumes you have a `text-field` component that extends `FormField`.

```ts
import { LitElement, html } from "lit";
import { customElement } from "lit/decorators.js";
import { FormController } from "@kin/form";

// Assumes the existence of a <text-field> component that extends KinField.
import "./text-field.ts";

interface User {
  email: string;
  name: string;
}

@customElement("login-form")
export class LoginForm extends LitElement {
  #form = new FormController<User>(this, {
    initialValue: {
      email: "",
      name: "",
    },
    onSubmit: async (form) => {
      // Simulate an API call.
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
      alert(`Submitted: ${JSON.stringify(form.value, null, 2)}`);
    },
  });

  protected override render() {
    const { field, handleSubmit, submitting } = this.#form;

    return html`
      <text-field label="Email" ${field("email")}></text-field>

      <text-field label="Name" ${field("name")}></text-field>

      <button .disabled=${submitting} @submit=${handleSubmit}>
        ${submitting ? "Logging in..." : "Log in"}
      </button>
    `;
  }
}
```

### Key Concepts

1.  **`FormController`**: This is the heart of your form. You create an instance of it in your Lit component, providing it with an initial data shape (`initialValue`) and a submission handler (`onSubmit`).

2.  **`field()` directive**: This directive binds a form field component (like `<text-field>`) to a specific property in your form's data model (e.g., `email`).

3.  **`handleSubmit()`**: This function, provided by the controller, orchestrates the submission process. It calls your `onSubmit` callback if the form is valid.
