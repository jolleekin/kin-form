title: Architecture
---

## Overview

Kin Form is built on a hierarchical and compositional architecture, making it flexible enough to handle everything from simple inputs to complex, deeply nested forms.

The architecture consists of three main components:

- **`FormField`**: The base class for all individual form fields (e.g., a text input, a checkbox, a select dropdown). It manages the value, validation, and status (touched, invalid, etc.) of a single piece of data.

- **`FieldGroup`**: A special type of field that contains other fields. It allows you to group fields together into a nested object structure. It aggregates the status of its children; for example, a `FieldGroup` is considered invalid if any of its child fields are invalid.

- **`FormController`**: The main controller that manages the entire form. It is a `FieldGroup` with additional logic for handling form submission, reset, and top-level state like `dirty` and `submitting`.

This structure allows you to compose complex forms by nesting `FormField` and `FieldGroup` components.

## How It Works in Practice

You typically instantiate a `FormController` in your Lit component. The controller then uses the `field()` directive to link parts of its data model to `FormField` or `FieldGroup` elements in your template.

```ts
interface Model {
  email: string;
  password: string;
}

class LoginPage extends LitElement {
  // The controller manages the form's state.
  #form = new FormController<Model>(this, {
    initialValue: { email: "", password: "" },
    onSubmit: (form) => {
      console.log("Form submitted!", form.value);
    },
  });

  protected override render(): unknown {
    const { field, handleSubmit } = this.#form;
    return html`
      <!-- The field() directive links these fields to the controller -->
      <text-field ${field("email")}></text-field>
      <password-field ${field("password")}></password-field>

      <button @click=${handleSubmit}>Log in</button>
    `;
  }
}
```

## Design Rationale

In Kin Form, `FormController` is implemented as a Lit `ReactiveController`, but it is also technically a custom element. This design was chosen to reduce boilerplate and improve developer ergonomics.

An alternative approach would be to use it as a traditional custom element, like `<kin-form>`.

```ts
// Alternative, more verbose approach
class LoginPage extends LitElement {
  protected override render(): unknown {
    return html`
      <kin-form
        .initialValue=${...}
        .onSubmit=${...}
        .template=${({field, handleSubmit}) => html`
          <text-field ${field('email')}></text-field>
          <button @click=${handleSubmit}>Log in</button>
        `}
      ></kin-form>
    `;
  }
}
```

This alternative is slightly more verbose and can be less efficient, as the template function may be recreated on each render. The current approach, using a `ReactiveController`, provides a more direct and streamlined way to manage form state within a Lit component.
