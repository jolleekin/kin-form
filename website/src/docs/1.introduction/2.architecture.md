## Current Architecture

The current architecture of the library is as follows.

![Architecture](/img/architecture.svg?2)

Notice that `FormController` is actually a custom element. However, it is being
used as a `ReactiveController`. This is chosen to reduce verbosity and to avoid
defining a template function.

```ts
interface Model {
  email: string;
  password: string;
}

class LoginPage extends LitElement {
  #form = new FormController<Model>(this, {
    initialValue: {...},
    onSubmit: (form) => {...},
  });

  protected override render(): unknown {
    const { field, handleSubmit } = this.#form;
    return html`
      <text-field ${field('email')}></text-field>
      <password-field ${field('password')}></password-field>
      <button @click=${handleSubmit}>Log in</button>
    `;
  }
}
```

## Alternative Architecture

An alternative approach is to make `FormController` a true custom element with
tag name `<kin-form>`, for example. With this approach, the above code may be
rewritten as follows.

```ts
class LoginPage extends LitElement {
  #initialValue: Model = {...};

  #onSubmit = (form: FormController<Model>) => {...};

  protected override render(): unknown {
    return html`
      <kin-form
        .initialValue=${this.#initialValue}
        .onSubmit=${this.#onSubmit}
        .template=${({field, handleSubmit}) => html`
          <text-field ${field('email')}></text-field>
          <password-field ${field('password')}></password-field>
          <button @click=${handleSubmit}>Log in</button>
        `}
      ></kin-form>
    `;
  }
}
```

This is slightly more verbose and less efficient since the `template` function
is re-created on each render. We can improve it by storing the `template`
function in a class field or define a factory function that creates a form
imperatively.

```ts
class LoginPage extends LitElement {
  #form = createForm<Model>({
    initialValue: {...},
    onSubmit: (form) => {...},
    template: ({field, handleSubmit}) => html`
      <text-field ${field('email')}></text-field>
      <password-field ${field('password')}></password-field>
      <button @click=${handleSubmit}>Log in</button>
    `,
  })

  protected override render(): unknown {
    return this.#form;
  }
}
```
