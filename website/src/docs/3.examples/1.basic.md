This example demonstrates a basic form with two fields using the generic element
`<kin-field>`.

For reusable form fields, consider creating custom elements that extend
`FormField<TValue, TParentValue>` or `FieldGroup<TValue, TParentValue>`.

## Key Concepts

This example showcases the simplest way to get a form up and running.

1.  **`FormController`**: We initialize a `FormController` with a `User` type, providing it with an `initialValue` and an `onSubmit` handler. The controller manages the entire state of the form.

2.  **`<kin-field>`**: This is a generic, unstyled wrapper element provided by the library. It's useful for simple forms or for when you want to provide a completely custom template for a field.

3.  **Custom Template**: The `<kin-field>` element accepts a `.template` property. This is a function that receives the field's state (`f`) and returns a Lit `html` template. This gives you full control over the field's appearance and behavior.

4.  **Binding with `field()`**: The `${this.#form.field('name')}` directive binds the `<kin-field>` element to the `name` property of the form's data. This handles the two-way data flow between the input and the form's state.

5.  **Event Handling**: The template connects standard DOM events like `@blur` and `@change` to the handler methods provided by the field state (`f.handleBlur`, `f.handleChange`), which updates the form controller automatically.
