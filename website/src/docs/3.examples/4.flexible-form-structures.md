This example demonstrates three ways to structure a form for nested data.

## Key Concepts

Kin Form provides several ways to handle nested data objects, like an address. This example shows three different patterns for binding fields to the `billingAddress`, `shippingAddress`, and `otherAddress` objects in the form's data model.

1.  **Flattened (Dot Notation)**: The simplest approach. You can bind directly to nested properties using a dot-separated path in the `field()` directive. This is great for simple cases where you don't need to create a reusable component for the nested fields.

    ```html
    <text-field ${field("billingAddress.line1")}></text-field>
    <text-field ${field("billingAddress.line2")}></text-field>
    ```

2.  **Generic Field Group (`<kin-field-group>`)**: For more complex cases, you can use the generic `<kin-field-group>` element. You bind it to the parent object (`shippingAddress`), and then within its `.template`, you use the group's `field()` directive to bind to the nested properties (`line1`, `line2`). This pattern is useful when you want to group fields together visually or apply group-level validation without creating a dedicated custom element.

    ```html
    <kin-field-group
      ${field("shippingAddress")}
      .template=${(g: KinFieldGroup<Address>) => html`
        <text-field ${g.field("line1")}></text-field>
        <text-field ${g.field("line2")}></text-field>
      `}
    ></kin-field-group>
    ```

3.  **Custom Field Group Component**: The most powerful and reusable pattern. Here, we use a dedicated `<address-field>` component, which is itself a `FieldGroup`. You simply bind this component to the `otherAddress` object. This encapsulates all the logic and UI for an address into a single, reusable component, making your main form cleaner and more modular.

    ```html
    <address-field ${field("otherAddress")}></address-field>
    ```

Choosing the right pattern depends on the complexity of your form and the level of reusability you need.
