This example demonstrates array field and array operations.<br/>
It also demonstrates the use of custom `valueFormatter` and `valueParser` on the unit price fields.

## Key Concepts

This example demonstrates how to manage a dynamic list of fields, a common requirement for things like order forms or editable invoices.

1.  **Binding to Array Items**: The `field()` directive can bind to a specific item in an array using dot notation with an index (e.g., `items.0.productId`). In the example, we use Lit's `repeat` directive to loop through the `items` array and generate a row for each item, using the index `idx` to create the correct binding for each field.

    ```html
    ${repeat(value.items, (_, idx) => idx, this.#itemTemplate)}
    ```

    ```ts
    // Inside the item template
    html`<select-field ${form.field(`items.${idx}.productId`)}></select-field>`
    ```

2.  **Array Manipulation API**: The `FormController` (which is a `FieldGroup`) provides methods for manipulating arrays in the form's value. You call the method with the path to the array and the necessary arguments.

    - `pushItem("items", ...)`: Adds a new item to the end of the `items` array.
    - `removeItem("items", idx)`: Removes the item at the specified `idx`.
    - `moveItem("items", idx, newIdx)`: Moves an item from one index to another.

    These methods automatically update the form state, triggering a re-render of the `repeat` directive.

3.  **Custom Formatting and Parsing**: The "Unit Price" field uses a `valueFormatter` to display the number as a currency string (e.g., "$10.00") and a `valueParser` to convert the string back into a number when the user changes it. This is useful for handling data that has a different representation in the UI versus the data model.

    ```html
    <number-field
      .valueParser=${parseCurrency}
      .valueFormatter=${formatCurrency}
      ${form.field(`items.${idx}.unitPrice`)}
    ></number-field>
    ```

4.  **Derived State with `@lit/task`**: The total price is calculated using `@lit/task`. The task is configured to re-run its calculation whenever the `items` array changes, providing a clean and reactive way to display computed values.
