This example demonstrates dependent field validation.

## Key Concepts

A common requirement in forms is for one field's validation to depend on another field's value, such as a "confirm password" field. Kin Form supports this with two key features:

1.  **The `dependents` Property**: The `password` field has a `dependents` property set to `["confirmPassword"]`. This tells the form that whenever the `password` field's value changes, it should automatically trigger a re-validation of the `confirmPassword` field. This ensures the validation logic is always run at the right time.

    ```html
    <text-field
      dependents='["confirmPassword"]'
      label="Password"
      ${field("password")}
    ></text-field>
    ```

2.  **Accessing the Parent**: Inside the validator for the `confirmPassword` field, we can access the parent `FieldGroup` (in this case, the `FormController` itself) via the `parent` property on the field state. This allows the validator to get the value of the `password` field (`parent.value.password`) and compare it to the current field's value.

    ```ts
    const confirmPasswordValidators = [
      // ... other validators
      ({ value, parent }: TextField<Model>) =>
        value === parent!.value.password ? null : "Passwords don't match",
    ];
    ```

By using `dependents` to trigger validation and the `parent` property to access sibling field values, you can easily implement complex cross-field validation rules.
